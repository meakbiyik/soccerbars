\usage{
scorebar(
  scores,
  twogoalline = FALSE,
  zerodots = FALSE,
  outlined = FALSE,
  color = NULL,
  show = TRUE,
  output_path = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{scores}{A list, a list of lists, a data.frame or a list of data.frames
of match scores. A match score list has the elements (matches) in either
of two alternative forms: three vectors of format
<home team score: int, away team score: int, is away game: logical>
or lists of three length-one elements with these datatypes. If the matches
are given as data.frames, then each column is expected to have the same
structure and data types as these alternatives. Some valid examples:
\itemize{
\item list(c(1,2,3), c(4,5,6), c(T,F,T))
\item list(list(1,4,T), list(2,5,F), list(3,6,T))
\item data.frame(list(home=c(1,2,3), away=c(4,5,6), flag=c(T,F,T)))
\item list(list(c(1,2), c(3,4), c(T,F)), list(c(5,6), c(7,8), c(T,F)))
}}

\item{twogoalline}{A logical, draws lines for two-goal levels,
by default FALSE.}

\item{zerodots}{A logical, marks no goals scored with a small dot,
by default FALSE.}

\item{outlined}{A logical, only plots the outlines of the sparklines,
by default FALSE.}

\item{color}{A vector or a list of vectors, specifying the color of each
scorebar. This option is provided to be consistent with LaTeX package API
and allows high configurability, but \code{home_color}, \code{away_color} and
\code{fill_color} options should already be sufficient for most of the use cases,
by default NULL. This parameter is expected to be structurally identical
with the \code{scores}: if a list of match score lists is given, then \code{color}
must also be a list of vectors.}

\item{show}{A logical, prints the plot, by default TRUE.}

\item{output_path}{A string or a vector of strings, path to save the plot
at (image type is inferred from the path), by default NULL. This parameter
is expected to be structurally identical with the \code{scores}: if a list of
match score lists is given, then \code{output_path} must have the same number
of elements with the number of score sets.}

\item{...}{A named list, additional configuration keywords for the
visualization. Not necessarily consistent with its latex counterpart,
but mostly a superset of it.
\itemize{
\item dpi: Dots per inch resolution, by default 300
\item thickness: Line thickness in cartesian coordinates, by default 0.18
\item edge_thickness: Edge thickness for outlined patches (when outlined=True)
as the ratio to the line thickness, by default 0.35
\item goalless_edge_thickness: Edge thickness for outlined no-goal patches
(when outlined=True) as the ratio to the line thickness, by default 0.5
\item zerodot: Zero-dot radius ratio to thickness (when zerodots = True),
by default 0.4
\item slant: Slope for unbalanced scores in degrees, by default 14
\item spacing: Spacing between matches in cartesian coordinates, by default 0.8
\item padding: Padding before and after the matches in cartesian coordinates,
by default 0.25
\item baseline_factor: Thickness of baseline with respect to line thickness,
by default 0.2
\item brighten: Brightness percentage of the two-goal lines (when
twogoalline = True) and away games (when outlined = False),
by default 33
\item transparent_background: Set the background transparent instead of white,
by default False
\item home_color: Color of home match lines in any of the three kinds of R
color specifications (i.e. either a color name as listed by colors(),
a hexadecimal string of the form "#rrggbb" or "#rrggbbaa",
or a positive integer i meaning \code{palette()[i]}), by default "black"
\item away_color: Color of away match lines in any of the three kinds of R
color specifications, by default "black"
\item baseline_color: Color of baselines in any of the three kinds of R
color specifications, by default "black"
\item fill_color: Fill color for the outlined sparklines in any of the three
kinds of R color specifications, by default NA.
\item clip_slanted_lines: Clip the ends of the slanted lines, by default True
}}
}
\value{
ggplot objects of the plots created. If the input is a list of
multiple matches, then the return is an iterable of ggplot objects, one per
each match score list.
}
\description{
Plot the given list or lists of match results as multivariate sparklines.
This function can either show the plot, or save it to a given path.
